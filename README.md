-   **Content Utilities**:
    -   **URL Shortener (`/l/[alias]`):** Custom short links that redirect to any external URL, complete with a countdown timer.
    -   **Pastebin (`/p/[alias]`):** A tool for sharing formatted code snippets with language-specific syntax highlighting.

> **Note on Content Management**
>
> All dynamic content (blog posts, short links, notes, and pastes) is managed through a separate, dedicated admin dashboard that interacts with the Appwrite backend. You can find the repository for the admin panel here: **[my-site-control-center](https://github.com/shajidhasan/my-site-control-center)**.
